Step 4 - Create HTK Training Script
-----------------------------------

Create an HTK codetrain.scp script in your 'voxforge/auto' folder containing the following information:

[codetrain.scp]

This is an HTK a file containing a list of each audio file you created in Step 3 and the name and location of the MFCC file (special HTK audio format) it will be converted to.Â  See Step 5 of the Tutorial ([Linux], [Windows]) for further details.
