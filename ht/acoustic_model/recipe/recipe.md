This acoustic model training recipe describes the creation of an Acoustic Model for the [Julius](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php?q=en/index.html) Speech Recognition Engine using the [HTK](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk) toolkit.  It follows the approach used by the tutorial in the [HTK book](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/docs/docs.shtml), but uses a script to automate most of the steps.
